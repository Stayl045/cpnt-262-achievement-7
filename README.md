# CPNT-262-Achievement-7- Stephan Taylor

## Plan

- My plan thus far is to take some of the components that I liked from the hackathon that that class did on March 23rd. I really liked what me and Bryan did with it and I feel confident I can use some of the content for achievement 7

- I will also attempt to use props in greater depth by using Ashs examples vue project as inspiration

- Then create a 3 card reusable components that we did not create from the hackathon day.

## Struggles with this Achievement

- I ran into issue installing vue via `npm install -D tailwindcss` where css styling wouldn't render for whatever reason.
  - To resolve this I instead used `vue add tailwind` and followed the direction. This seems to have resolved the issue.

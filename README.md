# CPNT-262-Achievement-7- Stephan Taylor

## Thoughts on this Achievement

- Overall, I again loved this achievement as it really let me explore aspects of component usage and styling with tailwindcss. I was able to learn a lot throughout this process that I will be using going forward into this profession.
- I was also able to create some reusable card components that i'll likely be looking to replicate going forward, although, with a more flare!

## Plan

- My plan thus far is to take some of the components that I liked from the hackathon that that class did on March 23rd. I really liked what me and Bryan did with it and I feel confident I can use some of the content for achievement 7

- I will also attempt to use props in greater depth by using Ashs examples vue project as inspiration

- Then create a 3 card reusable components that we did not create from the hackathon day.

- For tomorrow March 25th, I would like to get the 3 object cards background image to fill the whole space rather then just the bottom.

## March 25th

- Was able to follow through with yesterday's plan and create 3 functioning cards. However, I was not able to figure out how to make the array images into background images. I would really like to know if you don't mind teaching us how!

## Struggles with this Achievement

- I ran into issue installing vue via `npm install -D tailwindcss` where css styling wouldn't render for whatever reason.
  - To resolve this I instead used `vue add tailwind` and followed the direction. This seems to have resolved the issue.
- turns out I created the first card the wrong way without calling using JaveScript. I will attempt to follow the example on `vue-demo-2`
- Ran into another problem when trying to import my 2nd card components

  - At this point, I have no idea how to resolve this. I will play around with the components more and try to locate the issue
- Resolved
  - I was able to make background images of card 2s by binding them to the baseCard and using moustache syntax to in inject the images from the array
